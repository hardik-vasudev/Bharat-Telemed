Bharat TeleMed is built using a modern technology stack to provide a seamless and efficient telemedicine experience. The frontend is developed with React 18 and styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface. The backend is powered by Flask, which enables fast and scalable API responses. For data storage, we have integrated MongoDB/MySQL, allowing efficient retrieval and management of patient records. The system incorporates Machine Learning models built with TensorFlow/PyTorch to enhance AI-driven disease prediction based on symptoms. Secure telemedicine consultations are facilitated through Jitsi Meet, providing a robust video conferencing solution for remote doctor-patient interactions. Additionally, Docker is utilized for containerization, making deployment and scaling more efficient.
